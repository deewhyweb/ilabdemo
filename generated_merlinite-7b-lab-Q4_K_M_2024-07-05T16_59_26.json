Deductible: The Platinum level has a lower deductible of $500, while the Gold level has a $2000 deductible. This means that with the Platinum level, you would have to pay less out-of-pocket for each claim but would also have a higher monthly premium.\n\nIn summary, if you want more coverage and are willing to pay a higher premium, the Platinum level might be the best option. If you prefer a lower monthly payment and can accept slightly less coverage, the Gold level could be more suitable.
